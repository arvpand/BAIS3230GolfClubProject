## BAIST Golf Club Project

Club BAIST is a fancy golf club that started in 1996. They have a great 18-hole golf course that's challenging but fun for all levels of golfers. The club leaders want to make things easier by using computers to handle tee times, memberships, and keeping track of player scores.
